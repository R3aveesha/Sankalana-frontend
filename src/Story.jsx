            The Story Behind Sankalana
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
            Sankalana, meaning "coming together", was born from the belief that students need spaces to breathe, express, and belong. In a demanding academic journey, Sankalana emerged as a pause - a moment where music, movement, and emotion unite the planning community as one.

            What began as a student led cultural initiative has grown into a signature event of the Department of Town & Country Planning, carrying forward a legacy of creativity, collaboration, and purpose. Today, Sankalana is not just a concert, it is a shared experience where art meets empathy and celebration meets responsibility.
